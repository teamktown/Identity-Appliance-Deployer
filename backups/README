About Restore Points
====================

This installer creates a basic restore point of the files it touches.
Your milage may vary, as you may have made other edits to the files or files outside this list.

recoverypoints.txt has is a two column file of 'label' and then full filename for the file.

How to Return to a Previous Restore Point
==========================================
You have the choice of simply untar'ing the file in place and examining the differences or 
wholesale recovery.

Untaring the file in place does not overwrite the active files.
To do deploy the restore point change do these steps (as root)

cd /
tar xfv /full/path/to/restore/file.tar

***WARNING*** 
This will overwrite the current configuration.
Also note that it doesn't REMOVE any existing file, just overwrite. 
This may have implications if you hand edited files and then do a restore.
