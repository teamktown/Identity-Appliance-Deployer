Disclamer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intended to be used on a clean CentOS 6.4 'minimal' install or newer. 



Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inspired by the scripting work by SWAMID for installing an IDP, this is a variation
that will do an installation for eduroam.
The IDP pieces still reside in the script and will eventually be worked back 
into the build.

From ./deploy_idp.sh -h:

# This script is intended to deploy an eduroam ready FreeRADIUS server.      #
# It is derived from the SWAMID approach but only supports CAF eduroam 	     #
# at this time. 							     #
#                                                                            #
# Supported Federations:						     # 
#		CAF - (Canadian Access Federation) on CentOS		     #
#                                                                            #
# This script requires a configuration file or it will not run properly.     #

#                                                                            #
#	Steps to use the script:					     #
#		Create a configuration via: ~/www/index.html		     #
#		Save the config in this directory			     # 
#		Run the script: ./deploy_idp.sh [-h shows this message]      #
#		Join this machine to your domain: net join -U Administrator  #
#		Decide on your commercial TLS Certificate		     #
#		Send your request to tickets@canarie.ca to join eduroam	     #

Upgrading
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This iteration of the script has no upgrading functionality.
That said, it could be run multiple times with different configurations if so desired. 
The tool does a 'Restore Point' (aka a tar file of key files) in the 
./backup directory.
